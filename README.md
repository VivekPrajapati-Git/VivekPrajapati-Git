👋 Hi, I’m Vivek Prajapati

I’m a Bachelor’s student with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I enjoy building AI-powered applications and web-based projects that solve real-world problems. I’m always excited to explore new technologies and turn ideas into working systems.

Currently, I am learning PyTorch to deepen my understanding of machine learning and deep learning, and I am also preparing to move toward DevOps so I can build, deploy, and scale intelligent applications in cloud environments.

I enjoy working on:

🤖 AI & Machine Learning projects

🌐 Web development and backend systems

🛠️ Open-source and collaborative coding

🚀 Building complete, production-ready solutions

My goal is to become a developer who can not only build powerful AI models, but also deploy, manage, and scale them in real-world systems. I love learning, experimenting, and contributing to projects that make an impact.
